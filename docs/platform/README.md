# Platform Reference

Deep-dive reference for the MobileGym platform itself — useful when you're extending the simulator, adding a new system service, or debugging behavior that the [tutorials](../guides/) leave unexplained. Most casual users won't need any of this.

If you just want to run a benchmark or train an agent, start with [getting-started.md](../getting-started.md) and [architecture.md](architecture.md). Come here when those say "see `platform/<X>` for details."

## Companion reference

- 🔌 Browser-side debug & automation APIs (`__SIM__`, `__OS__`, …) → [`../api/runtime-api.md`](../api/runtime-api.md)
- 🧪 Tasks, judging, and runner internals → [`../../bench_env/docs/`](../../bench_env/docs/)

## Conventions used in these docs

- **Code fences** show real, in-repo file paths and identifiers — what you see is what `grep` will find.
- **Tables** are the load-bearing format. We avoid prose for things that are really just enumerations.
- **`(internal)` tags** mark behavior used only by the framework itself; you shouldn't need it when building apps.
- These docs are written against the **current** main branch. If something here disagrees with the code, file an issue — the code wins.
